Program is receiving all tweets via csv file, it is required that csv file is containing a field called 'text' with the text content of the tweet. 
It is required as well a field in csv called 'sentiment' having an integer as identificator of the cluster as word clouds and histograms will be
created per cluster.

Wiki üìñ
The program uses the following structure:
In project folder we can find a data folder to hold data used for the program which basically will be the csv file once is uncompressed, and data generated by the program as the csv file once has been preprocessed.
Ther is a data/output folder where all files generated as the word clouds and the histograms will be placed.

Getting ready üöÄ
You could obtain a copy of the software for your personal use or development purposses cloning the following project: https://github.com/jenrari/process_wordcloud
Take a look to deployment section to know how to deploy and execute the project

Requisites üî©
